## AiDex - Use for ALL code searches

**Default:** Whenever you would grep for a symbol/name (class, function, variable), use AiDex first. Do **not** use grep for that when the project has a `.aidex/` directory. Never use grep to find where a class/function/variable is defined or used when `.aidex/` exists.

**Tools (MCP server `user-aidex`):**
- `aidex_query` — Find classes, functions, variables by name (path + term; mode: exact/contains/starts_with). Use this instead of grep for "where is X defined/used."
- `aidex_signature` — All methods in one file with line numbers
- `aidex_signatures` — Methods from multiple files (glob pattern)
- `aidex_summary` — Project overview and entry points

**Workflow:** When finding how/where something is used or defined (e.g. "how is X used?", "where is X defined?", "where is X used?"), call `aidex_query` with the project path and the symbol name, then use those results (and read the listed files if needed). Only use grep if AiDex is unavailable or returns no results.
